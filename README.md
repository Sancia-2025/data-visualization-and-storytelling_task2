# Superstore Sales Dashboard – Data Visualization and Storytelling

This project is part of the Data Analyst Internship Task 2, where the objective was to creat meaningful visualizations and present data insights using Power BI.

## 📊 Objective
To analyze the Superstore dataset and create a visual dashboard that highlights key insights related to:
- Sales performance  
- Profit distribution  
- Customer segments  
- Regional performance  
- Time-based sales trends  

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop  
- Superstore Dataset (CSV/Excel)

## 📈 Visuals Included in the Dashboard
1. **Sales by Region**  
2. **Sales by Category**  
3. **Sales by Segment (Pie Chart)**  
4. **Profit by Sub-Category**  
5. **Sales Trend Over Time (Order Date)**  

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Technology** is the highest revenue-generating category.  
- The **West region** leads in total sales, followed by East.  
- **Consumer segment** contributes the highest proportion of sales.  
- **Copiers, Phones, and Accessories** are among the most profitable sub-categories.  
- Sales show consistent performance over the years with visible seasonality.

## 📖 Storytelling Summary
The Superstore dataset reveals important patterns about how different categories, customers, and regions contribute to overall business performance.

The analysis shows that Technology is the top-performing category with the highest sales, followed by Furniture and Office Supplies.
At a regional level, the West region leads in total sales, followed by the East, while the South region performs the lowest.

Customer behavior also plays a significant role in sales distribution. The Consumer segment contributes over 50% of total sales, making it the primary target market. Corporate and Home Office segments follow but with smaller shares.

Profitability varies sharply across sub-categories. Items like Copiers and Phones generate the highest profits, while categories like Tables and Bookcases show lower profitability, indicating potential pricing or cost issues.

Over time, sales display a consistent trend with seasonality patterns. This suggests regular spikes during certain months, which can help in forecasting demand and planning inventory.

Overall, the story highlights that:
Technology and Consumer segments drive major revenue
,West region is the strongest market
,Some sub-categories are highly profitable, while others need attention
,Sales follow predictable seasonal trends

This understanding helps businesses focus on high-performing areas and improve weak segments to maximize overall growth.
